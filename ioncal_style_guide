# Installation of ioncal

library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("putt-ad/ioncal")

##### rClean the header (est. time = 2 min) #####
# manually open the document and remove all empty cells. Ioncal uses the concentration values from the IC detectors. 
# This means remove retetention time, amount, peak percent and all others aside from measured concentration (Âµs/cm).

head(your_df) 
# must look like this
Inj.	Injection.Name	Type 	analyte1	analyte2	analyte3

##### make your standards detectable (est. time = 5 min) #####
# ensure that the standard concentrations are listed under "Injection.Name" (without units).
# ensure that the standard has a unique identifier listed under "Type" here we used "standard2"
# make sure that your samples to be calibrated are all labeled as "Type" = "Unknown"
# you can leave other calibrations standards in as they will not be detected nor will they interfere with calibaration

View(your_df)
# check these results against the provided data "ion_test.csv"

##### read file as dataframe #####
your_df <- read.csv ("name_of_your_ion_data.csv")
head(your_df)
View(your_df)

##### test calibration using ion_test.csv dataset #####
ion_test <- read.csv("ion_test.csv")
ioncal(ion_test)
name of calibration standard: oas

##### now use your data #####
ioncal(your_df)

#the function will prompt you for the name of your standard
name of calibration standard:
